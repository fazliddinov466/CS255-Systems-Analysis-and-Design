This repository contains my CS 255 DriverPass project.  It includes the Business Requirements Document, System Design Document, and a reflection  on my software design and development process.

# CS 255 Module Eight Journal ‚Äì DriverPass Reflection

## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project.
The DriverPass project was created for a client who wanted an online system to help students prepare for driving exams. The system allows students to take practice tests, schedule driving lessons, and track their progress. It also includes tools for instructors, secretaries, and administrators to manage lessons, reports, and user accounts.

## What did you do particularly well?
I did a good job identifying the client‚Äôs needs and turning them into clear requirements. My documentation and diagrams show how each part of the system connects and how users interact with it.

## If you could revise one part of your work, what would you pick and how would you improve it?
I would improve the System Design Document by adding more detail to the class and data flow diagrams. That would make it easier for developers to understand how the system works behind the scenes.

## How did you interpret the user‚Äôs needs and implement them into your system design?
I used the client interview and user stories to understand what each user type needed ‚Äî students, instructors, and administrators. Then, I designed the system so each user can easily perform their main tasks. Considering user needs is important because it makes the system more practical and successful.

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future?
I like to start by gathering and organizing all requirements first. Then I use diagrams and iterative design to plan out how the system will work. In the future, I will continue using structured analysis, visual modeling, and user feedback to improve my designs.
