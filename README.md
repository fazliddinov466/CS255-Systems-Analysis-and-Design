This repository contains my CS 255 DriverPass project.  It includes the Business Requirements Document, System Design Document, and a reflection  on my software design and development process.


# CS 255 Module Eight Journal ‚Äì DriverPass Reflection

## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project.
The DriverPass project was created for a client named Liam, who wanted an online system that helps students prepare for driving exams. The system allows users to take practice tests, schedule driving lessons, and track their progress. It also includes accounts for instructors, administrators, and secretaries to manage lessons, reports, and student information.

## What did you do particularly well?
I did a good job clearly identifying user requirements and designing the system to meet each need. My diagrams and documentation explained how all parts of the system connect, making it easy to understand the workflow between users and data.

## If you could revise one part of your work, what would you pick and how would you improve it?
I would improve the System Design Document by adding more detail to the data flow and class diagrams. This would make it easier for future developers to understand exactly how the back-end connects to the user interface.

## How did you interpret the user‚Äôs needs and implement them into your system design?
I used the client interview and user stories to define what each user role needed ‚Äî students, instructors, and administrators. By focusing on those roles, I designed features that made the system easy to use and matched real-world tasks. Meeting user needs is essential because it ensures the software actually solves the problems it was built for.

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future?
I like to start by gathering detailed requirements and organizing them visually through use case and class diagrams. I follow an iterative process ‚Äî planning, designing, testing, and improving. In future projects, I‚Äôll continue to focus on user-centered design and clear documentation to make sure both users and developers can easily work with the system.
